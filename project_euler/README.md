=================
This is where I store all my solutions for <b>projecteuler.net</b> (programmed in C++).
I use project euler primarily to help me discover my weaknesses in math. Its a tool I use to
help me understand math in a fun and engaging way but also to sharpen up my problem solving, and
independent research skills.
